    moment,my dreams of pursuing a career in tech seemed to hang in the balance. </p>

    <p>But just when i thought things couldn't get worse,i received another devastating blow.When my 
      WAEC result was finally released,I was dishearted to discover that one of my core subject
       (CHEMISTRY) essential for gaining admission into my desired course,had been cancelled. The
        cancellation was not only jeopardized my chances of securing admission but also forced me to
         re-evaluate my academic plans.</p>
    <p>Despite these setbacks,I refused to let them define me.Instead I channeled my frustation
         into determination,seeking alternative paths to achieve my goals.I began to explore
          online resources,tutorials and mentorship programs that could help me develop the skills I need 
          to succeed in the tech indusry.That was when i learnt about ALTSCHOOL Africa(alternative to 
          school) as I used to call it.My Name is Kafilah Mustapha,a driven and curious individual with
           a passion for innovation and problem-solving.I'm excited to leverage the program's resources and
        network to launch my career in tech and contribute to the growth of the indusrty in Africa</p>
